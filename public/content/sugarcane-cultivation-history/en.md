# Sugarcane Cultivation in This Region: How Many Millennia Ago?

**Prabhat Sapkota** | Teacher and Litterateur

Tokha, a land bearing a history defined by persistent struggles, is also unparalleled in its creativity. By raising its own pinnacle of achievement, this land has stood as an example to others. All the heritage sites we take pride in today emerged from the unerring vision of our ancestors—those who believed in a philosophy that moves beyond valuing mere knowledge to walking hand-in-hand with wisdom and labor (*karma*).

The current context is centered on sugarcane and Chaku. Sugarcane entered domestic use only after humans emerged from the forests and began living in huts, shanties, or houses. While the exact determination of when sugarcane use began in our region will continue through the work of botanists, research indicates that sugarcane originated in Southeast Asia. The people of 'New Guinea' utilized sugarcane as a crop 6,000 years ago, whereas its use in India appears to have started much later.

In Nepal, sugarcane cultivation has evidently existed since ancient times. According to the 'Sushruta Samhita', created by the ancient surgeon Sushruta, sugarcane juice was utilized as medicine since antiquity. Referencing Sushruta’s texts, researcher Saurav has shown that the history of 'Nepali Sugarcane' began four millennia ago. At that time, 'Nepal' referred to what is now the Kathmandu Valley, and it is common knowledge that the name Tokha stands foremost in the Valley for sugarcane and Chaku.

Why was Nepali sugarcane discussed in the 'Sushruta Samhita'? Could it be because sugarcane juice from other regions was not considered suitable for treatment? What made the sugarcane juice here healthier? Contemplating the likely answers to such questions and examining ancient facts, one can infer that the quality of Nepali sugarcane was of the highest level for human health. Consequently, Nepali sugarcane earned the opportunity to become famous long ago. Crucially, when searching for the history of our 'Tu' and 'Khya' (sugarcane cultivation), one must investigate the era of Sushruta. Researchers estimate his period to be between 2,600 and 3,000 years ago. Furthermore, it is unlikely that Sushruta recorded sugarcane in his texts the very year it entered domestic use. It is necessary to estimate the starting period of cultivation by considering the time it took for sugarcane to be planted, publicly utilized, and for its quality and fame to spread across the hills. How many centuries after we began cultivation did great health experts like Sushruta discover it? On what date was the healthy quality of this sugarcane juice first identified? Where is the first point in time when sugarcane juice was formally used for health?

Studies find ancient references to sugarcane cultivation from Burma to Tibet. Keeping these diverse realities in mind and looking at the evidence found so far, the history of 'Nepalechhu' or Nepali sugarcane appears to have begun four millennia ago. Once the juice extracted from the body of the sugarcane transformed into treacle and jaggery, and finally reached the form of Chaku, there was no need to retell the story of how Tokha’s fame—once limited to Asia—became global. Today, Chaku has become our very nature (*Dharma*).

A readiness for action ensured our ancestors were not limited to sugarcane alone. The need arose to crush the cane, collect the juice, and boil it to create jaggery. One necessity led to another, inspiring our ancestors to find new ways to craft delicious Chaku. Transforming sugarcane into juice, juice into jaggery, and jaggery into Chaku! How happy must our ancestors have been on the day their newly created sweet was ready? How was Chaku first utilized for profit? When did the sentiment arise to recognize it as a pure and sacred (safe) element? Along with these questions, history now shows a long series of journeys. In reality, the labor capacity of our ancestors was revealed long ago; one cannot engage in such serious work without prior intellectual capacity. To be able to provide successful results is even more commendable. The creation resulting from the experiments and tests of our ancestors—the novel sweet Chaku—is in all our hands today. As a result, our minds, eyes, nose, tongue, ears, and labor capacity have become even more active in identifying the significant value of sugarcane and Chaku.

In truth, it is difficult to reveal our inner facts until a thorough investigation of the fossils left by nature and the botanical remains crushed within rocks is conducted. Was there no soil to grow sugarcane plants in the various layers of our Himalayan cliffs and the Mahabharata range? What is the botanical relationship between 'Nigale' sugarcane and the 'Sito' (wild reeds) seen today in the ravines? Did sugarcane plants arrive here from New Guinea in Southeast Asia? Or did plants obtained from local forests enter our sugarcane fields? If it began to be used domestically from local forests, could our usage not be even older than that of New Guinea 6,000 years ago? These are all facets for research.

Today, with the history of sugarcane—which has been in use for thousands of years—standing as a witness, an immense desire and intense interest are surging toward the creation of our own original sweet, Chaku. At such a time, if we can deliver just one ball of Chaku per year into the hands of 3.5 billion out of the 7 billion people scattered across the world, it is certain that our dream today will turn into reality.
