# They Say It’s Not Good, Yet They Snatch It and Eat It

"Hey brother! How can you eat anything made from jaggery kept in such a dirty place?"
"No, no—this batch is actually for making alcohol. The jaggery for making Chaku is kept in a completely different, clean area!"

Jeevan Shrestha, the son of Bhakta Shrestha from Twapacha, has spent 25 years running a Chaku cottage industry. In a small town like Tokha, there used to be only five such Chaku industries in operation. Unlike other trades, this work is far from easy; while almost every task in this modern era is performed by machines, no equipment has been designed to facilitate this specific craft.

Bhakta says, “This Chaku business is very difficult, but the income is good. I have spent six decades in it. In the old days, selling Chaku was even more challenging. There were no proper roads. We had to carry it in *Kharpans* (shoulder-pole baskets) for a journey of 5 to 6 days to reach various villages. Even then, we didn't receive cash; we had to barter Chaku for grains like paddy, millet, corn, wheat, and barley.”

“Many rowdy people would claim the Chaku wasn't tasty even if it was delicious just to avoid giving us grain, and they would send us back telling us to come later. In certain places like Nuwakot, Bhaktapur, and Lalitpur, they would simply snatch it from us and eat it. In some places, it is still like this,” Bhakta Shrestha recounts his stories.

Bhakta continues, “Since it is made using traditional household methods, we must also take risks. While making Chaku, I have burned my hands and feet so many times that I still have the scars. One must also endure the smoke from the fire. If boiling jaggery splashes on the body, the burn is worse than that of molten tar. Chaku sells mostly during the winter season. During festivals like *Yomari* and *Maghe Sankranti*, there are very few people who do not eat Chaku.”

According to Bhakta, Chaku is also used as medicine. It is highly valued for treating colds, coughs, and menstrual irregularities, and is heavily utilized by postpartum mothers. Particularly in the Newar community, Chaku is essential for finalizing marriage negotiations. Culturally, it is believed that if a whole Chaku is sent to relatives after a birth, it signals a boy; if only half is sent, it’s a girl. Some even believe in feeding "blessed" Chaku to those bitten by rabid dogs. Thus, the significance of Chaku is immense.

The demand for Chaku is increasing beyond the Kathmandu Valley and even abroad. It is exported from Tokha across Nepal and to countries like the USA, Europe, and Australia. He estimates that up to 40 *muris* of Chaku are sold during the season. Bhakta remembers supporting his entire family through this trade. He notes there are two types of jaggery—yellow and black; yellow jaggery is used to make Chaku.

Bhakta reflects, “My parents worked much harder than I did. I have also worked in this profession for many years, and now my sons and grandsons are carrying on this legacy. Because the work is so grueling, not everyone enters this trade. *'Tokhaya Chaku, Macha Bulan Haku'* (Tokha's Chaku makes a baby dark-skinned) is a saying often linked to Chaku. In Tokha, which is famous for Chaku, there are many such legends. Chaku is deeply connected to our social foundation here.”

Bhakta Shrestha recalls, “There were originally five Chaku industries in Tokha. Two were in a place called Chimta, two in Tarcha, and one in Chulu. Previously, everyone in Tokha cultivated sugarcane in their own fields; thus, Chaku was produced from jaggery in almost every home. The local Tokha sugarcane was a thin variety called *Nigale*, about the thickness of a thumb. It was given to visitors to take with them, and because it was so delicious, it quickly became famous.”

The situation has changed now. In Tokha Municipality, north of the capital, about 15 to 20 people are currently engaged in the Chaku-making profession. It is no longer produced as abundantly as it was in the years 1955–56 (2012–13 BS). Only those continuing an ancestral legacy are carrying the torch. Among them, Jeevan Shrestha says, “I am only doing this work because I didn't want to abandon the profession my grandfather started. When I couldn't sustain my life with this trade, I spent a few years working in Korea. Now, I also run a grocery store.”

However, Chaku production is still financially viable. Jeevan shares that his turnover can reach nearly 2 million rupees in a single season. Making Chaku from October to the end of January covers his expenses for seven months. His father adds, “I learned from my father, and my son learned from me. Even the grandsons have already learned. How could the art of making Chaku in Tokha ever disappear!”

Despite that, the current situation is not very promising. As sugarcane is no longer available locally, the work is being continued by bringing in jaggery from outside. Gradually, due to a lack of capital or raw materials, many left the profession to spend their days as masons, carpenters, or contractors. Currently, they are forced to bring jaggery from Kapilvastu in the Terai and other regions.

Because Tokha Chaku is so famous, people from outside come here to learn the craft. However, local farmers do not want to openly share the "secret" of their method. Krishnalal Maharjan, who came from Bhaktapur to learn, says: “I’ve been learning for two months; it will take more time to make Chaku exactly like Tokha’s.” He hopes to master the craft here, move to the city, and earn a living.

Local resident Krishna Bahadur Shrestha states that primarily three types of Chaku—plain local and special varieties—are made in Tokha. He says, “Tokha used to supply about 75 percent of the Kathmandu Valley's Chaku. Even now, the Chaku made here holds a strong grip on the market. Our artisans even travel to Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Asan, and Khokana to make Chaku on-site.”

Today's traders often sell low-quality Chaku as "Tokha Chaku," which greatly affects the reputation of local producers. But Bhakta Shrestha says you can tell the difference: “When you break authentic Tokha Chaku, it shatters like glass; Chaku from elsewhere doesn't do that. Furthermore, Chaku made elsewhere is often damp.”

In reality, when Tokha farmers shifted to crops like corn, dry-land rice, peanuts, and soybeans, they stopped planting *Nigale* sugarcane. Over time, the settlement grew, and the local sugarcane seeds became extinct. Today, if jaggery stops coming from the outside, the authentic taste and existence of the famous Tokha Chaku will be found only in history books.
