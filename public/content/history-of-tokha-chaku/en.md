# The History of Tokha Chaku

**Author: Krishna Bahadur Shrestha**

Just as Khokana is famous for oil, Bhaktapur for Juju Dhau, Palpa for the Karua, and Thasi (Siddhipur) for straw mats, Tokha is renowned for its **Chaku**. There is a local proverb in Tokha: *"Tokhaya Chaku Macha Bulan Haku"* (Eating Tokha Chaku makes a newborn dark-skinned). Another logic suggests that when children used to visit the Chaku factories to beg for sweets, they were sent back with black soot smeared on them, leading onlookers to jokingly claim the children had turned dark.

Sugarcane cultivation and jaggery (*Sakhar*) production have existed here since the **Lichhavi era**. According to the book *Anupanmanjari* in the National Archives, consuming jaggery or molasses with honey for three evenings can destroy ignorance—much like the company of saints—and soothe "iron-related disorders." Ancient texts like *Ajirnamanjari* note that various ailments can be cured using concoctions of sugarcane juice, ginger, and other medicinal herbs.

Records from the Department of Archaeology (No. 218) indicate that the area currently known as Tokha-Panchatar was called **Tokhatar**. Historical evidence from the Shah era (Nepal Samvat 988) confirms that sugarcane farming and Chaku production were thriving even then. Research shows there were once six major Chaku-making sites: Chimantal (two), Tarcha, Charle, Chowali, Phansitang, and Palkhel. 

Today, these original sites have vanished. Where sugarcane was once crushed, modern concrete buildings stand. By 1993 (2050 BS), many of these fields were used for corn and soybeans; now, modern Chaku industries operate using new methods. Elders reminisce that the flavor of old Chaku would "hang on the tongue"—so potent that eating 200 grams would leave a person unable to get out of bed for two days! 

### Traditional Production (The Yansi Method)
In the past, every household grew sugarcane on at least half a *ropani* of land. Planting occurred in March (*Chaitra*) and harvesting by November (*Mangsir*). The production shed was called a **Chaku Bhugay**, featuring a massive 20-foot wooden beam called a **Yansi**. 

To extract juice, workers balanced on bamboo rails and used their body weight to pump the *Yansi* up and down, crushing the sugarcane bundles (*Kali*). The juice (*Sakh-ti*) was boiled in a specific numbered sequence (1, 2, 3, 4 then reversed) for 15 to 30 minutes until it thickened into a pliable mass. 

### Cultural & Ritual Significance
Chaku is vital to the Newar life cycle:
* **Birth & Death:** It is used in the *Chipa Thikegu* (purification) ritual after death and sent to a daughter's home (*Saha Kankegu*) when a child is born.
* **Marriage:** It is a traditional gift brought by the groom's side during the *Lakh Yanegu* ceremony.
* **Religion:** It is essential for *Panchamrit* in Satyanarayan prayers and is used in *Dewali* rituals.
* **Health:** Pilgrims to Gosaikunda carry Chaku and ginger to ward off the cold and altitude sickness. 

Chaku is regarded as a "pure" (*Chokho*) substance. If these traditions and histories are lost, it marks a decline in human heritage. We must strive to preserve them.
