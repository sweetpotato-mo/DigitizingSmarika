# The History of Tokha Chaku

**Author: Krishna Bahadur Shrestha**

Just as Khokana is famous for its oil, Bhaktapur for its *Juju Dhau* (king curd), Palpa for its *Karua* (brass vessel), and Thasi (Siddhipur) for its straw mats, Tokha is renowned for its **Chaku**. There is a local saying in Tokha: *"Tokhaya Chaku Macha Bulan Haku,"* meaning that consuming Tokha Chaku results in babies being born with dark skin. Another argument suggests that when children visited Chaku factories to beg for sweets, they were sent back with black soot smeared on them, leading observers to joke that the children had turned dark.

Sugarcane cultivation and jaggery (*Sakhar*) production have been practiced here since the **Lichhavi era**. According to the book *Anupanmanjari* preserved in the National Archives, those who consume honey along with treacle or jaggery for three consecutive evenings can destroy ignorance—much like the company of saints—and find relief from "iron-related disorders." Medicinal ingredients such as raisins, ash gourd, treacle, jaggery, basil, fennel, cloves, and *Nagkeshar*, when prepared with butter, sesame, and milk, are said to cure ailments caused by the *Bhallatak* (marking nut) plant. (Dr. Chhatrapati, p. 4)

It is documented in the book *Ajirnamanjari* (p. 7) that drinking a mixture of one *Prastha* of cow's milk and two *Palas* of jaggery neutralizes the poison of Datura. This is certain: the combination of saffron, water chestnut, lotus root, raisins, dates, and jaggery cooked with dried ginger serves as a remedy. Similarly, sugarcane juice processed with ginger juice or the ash of Palas leaves is noted as a curative for indigestion.

According to the records of the Department of Archaeology (No. 218), the Tokha settlement in Panchetar was historically known as **Tokhatar**. Historical evidence from the Shah era (Nepal Samvat 988) confirms that sugarcane was farmed and processed into jaggery and Chaku even then (Saubhagya Pradhananga, Chief Ed., p. 157).

Research confirms that sugarcane was cultivated and Chaku produced within Tokha itself. There were six primary production sites: Chimantal (two sites), Tarcha (currently a housing area), Charle, Chowali, Phansitang, and Palkhel. Farmers would plant sugarcane in whatever areas were most convenient for them. While Tokha is famous for Chaku, its historical remains are now disappearing. In the past, people performed the crushing and cooking themselves, but the traditional **Bhugay** (production huts) no longer exist in Tokha. Until 1993 (2050 BS), these former production sites were used to grow corn, dry-land rice, soybeans, and peanuts; today, modern concrete houses have taken over. Modern technology has replaced the old, and Chaku industries are now operated using new methods.

Elders in Tokha recall that in the past, the flavor of Chaku would linger on the tongue. Today’s Chaku lacks that intensity. They say that if someone consumed about 200 grams of the old Chaku, the energy was so intense they wouldn't be able to get out of bed for two days.

Just as one must be born a calf to enjoy pure cow's milk, those born today cannot experience the true, original taste of Chaku. To enjoy the authentic flavor, one would have to have been born in an earlier era—something which is no longer possible.

A study indicates that every household in Tokha used to cultivate sugarcane on one or two *ropanis* of land, and even those with less would use at least half a *ropani*. Sugarcane was planted throughout the month of April (*Chaitra*). The top foot of the stalk was set aside, and the lower portion was selected as seed (*Pusa*). Harvesting occurred by early November (*Mangsir*). The leaves and skin were removed, and the stalks were placed in pits (4ft x 8ft), covered with straw and soil for 30–35 days before being retrieved.

The production site was called a **Chaku Bhugay** (hut) in the local language. These huts were roughly 32 feet long. For juice extraction, thick wooden pillars (*Samba*)—about 8–9 inches thick—were buried 4 feet into the ground on both sides. A horizontal beam called the **Yansi**, measuring 18 to 20 feet, was joined to these pillars with wooden pins (*Chukul*) and bound with leather straps.

To extract the juice, the *Yansi* had to be pressed down. Bamboo stakes were driven into the ground around it. Sugarcane pieces were beaten with wooden mallets (*Mungra*) and arranged in bundles of 20–25 pieces, known as a **Kali** or **Bhari**. These were placed under the *Yansi* and pressed to extract the juice, which flowed through a wooden trough into a collection vessel.

Laborers balanced themselves on bamboo rails while holding on for stability, using their body weight to pump the *Yansi* up and down to extract juice from the sugarcane. This juice, known as **Sakh-ti**, was boiled in stages (numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 then reversed). The process took 15 to 30 minutes until the juice thickened into a paste, which was then molded into the desired shapes.

The Chaku was molded into rounds or slabs. In the past, famous stamps like *Maili*, *Saili*, and *Kanchi* (representing the three fingers) were used to brand the product. Some were even molded into round pigeon-like shapes. The finished Chaku was wrapped in green leaves (*Lapu*) to make bundles, with production scheduled to finish 15 days before the festival.

A team of 11 workers was required for the process: six for cutting the cane, two for beating it, one to operate the press, and two to manage the boiling. Essential traditional tools included *Nyakhin* (leather straps), *Yansi*, *Swayo*, and *Thwakota*.

The process was marked by communal feasts like **Tusa Puja** (during the pitting of sugarcane) and **Nayah Puja** (hosted by the leader for the workers). Rituals involved maintaining strict purity (*Nisu*). After sacrifices, traditional Newar feasts consisting of *Samaybaji*, fish, meat, and soybeans were served to celebrate the production.

Chaku holds immense significance in life and death within our community. During mourning rituals, Chaku, liquor, beaten rice, and ginger are used in the **Chipa Thikegu** ceremony. For births, Chaku and spices are taken to the daughter's home to announce the news (**Saha Kankegu**). In Newar marriages, the groom’s family brings Chaku to the bride’s house during the *Lakh Yanegu* ceremony.

In religious rituals, Chaku and jaggery are essential for making *Apung* and *Panchamrit* for Satyanarayan prayers. It is also used during **Dewali** consultations (*Sanya*). Pilgrims traveling to **Gosaikunda** carry Chaku, ginger, and beaten rice, believing that the combination wards off the cold and prevents altitude sickness. Chaku is regarded as a highly pure (*Chokho*) substance. As these historical traditions and techniques fade, we risk losing a vital part of our identity; let us protect them as much as possible.
