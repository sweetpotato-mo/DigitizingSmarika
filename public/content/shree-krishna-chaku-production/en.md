# Shree Krishna Chaku Production Pvt. Ltd.

**Located in the historic town of Tokha at the base of Shivapuri Hill in the northern region of Nepal Mandal, this land is tied to ancient customs as evidenced by a Lichhavi-era stone inscription from the year 519. Various festivals are celebrated throughout the year in Tokha, highlighting the remarkable traditions, rituals, and culture of the Newar community. Our current focus is on Chaku, an essential element for festivals like Yomari Punhi and Maghe Sankranti.**

For *Yomari*, Chaku is used as a filling along with sesame, coconut powder, and *khuwa* (milk solids). For *Maghe Sankranti*, sesame balls (*tilaura*) are prepared on the last day of the month of Poush. Early the next morning, after performing prayers, families gather around 9–10 AM in the warm sun. Children and grandchildren are called to enjoy a variety of foods including ghee, Chaku, sesame laddus, spinach, fenugreek greens, and *Samaybaji* (comprising beaten rice, marinated meat, soybeans, fish, and ginger). Following the meal, the head of the household applies mustard oil to the crowns and ears of family members, rubbing it onto their bodies before sunbathing. Culturally, it is believed that applying mustard oil to the crown and ears sharpens eyesight, enhances memory, and strengthens muscles. Daughters and sisters return to their paternal homes to join the *Ghyo-Chaku Sallhu* festivities. Joined by such numerous festivals and customs, we continue to move forward on the path of life.


**The Words of My Father, Krishnalal Shrestha**:
"I would now like to describe the hardships and journey of Shree Krishna Chaku Production Pvt. Ltd. According to our grandfather, Astaman Shrestha, my father had five sons and two daughters (presently four sons and two daughters remain). In this lineage, the son of my eldest brother, Mr. Ashalal Shrestha, embraced the Chaku profession. The business previously held by my second eldest brother, Kashilal Shrestha, is now managed by my nephews. Similarly, my third brother handles the sales of the Chaku I produce. Our relationship with this profession is as close as "nail and flesh." Chaku is the fame of our locality. My family underwent immense struggle to establish this profession here. From the time I began until now, much has changed. It is my vision to gradually enhance its quality and expand its reach in the market."

**Me,Krishna Bahadur Shrestha and My Business**
My life has been continuously intertwined with the Chaku profession. I was born in Tokha on November 1, 1980 (Kartik 15, 2037 BS). My childhood passed alongside my studies, and I completed my SLC (School Leaving Certificate). Even before my SLC exams, I started and operated a small grocery store. To promote trade and produce high-quality Chaku, I registered a private firm on November 17, 2005 (Mangsir 2, 2062 BS). I received certificate No. 22707/513 from the Government of Nepal’s Department of Commerce under the Act of 2014 BS. With registration from the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control (License No. 747, 2063/2064 BS) and municipal registration, I have been operating Shree Krishna Chaku Production Pvt. Ltd. Additionally, I currently serve as the Chairperson of the Tokha Traditional Chaku Preservation Society. The company is affiliated with the Chamber of Commerce and the Nepal Distributors Association. Registering across these various bodies has ensured that our operations run smoothly.

To date, Shree Krishna Chaku Production has provided connoisseurs with various flavors and forms of Chaku. Our product line includes Plain Chaku, Masala Chaku, Special Chaku, Khuwa Chaku, Sutkeri Chaku, Liquid (*Jhol*) Chaku, and white and black sesame laddus. Our market has expanded to 75 of Nepal's 77 districts and even abroad. The raw material, jaggery (*sakhar*), is imported from Krishnanagar, Raninagar, Nuwakot, Birtamod, and various parts of India. Unfortunately, it has been observed that monopolistic traders in Kalimati, Kathmandu, often manipulate the market by stockpiling jaggery during the peak season to create a syndicate and sell it at inflated prices. By doing so, these large-scale traders attempt to destabilize the Chaku entrepreneurs of Tokha.

The time has come for those involved in the Chaku business within the Tokha Traditional Chaku Preservation Society to unite. Only the Kalimati traders traditionally bring in jaggery during the months of Mangsir and Poush. Due to their monopoly and arbitrary pricing, Tokha's Chaku entrepreneurs are suffering. Consequently, it is time to join hands through the Preservation Society to standardize prices, branding, and quality.

Until 1984 (2041 BS), there was no plastic for packaging Chaku in the market. Back then, plastic rolls were available; we would cut them to size and seal the packaging using the heat of a small oil lamp (*tuki*). Since 1982 (2039 BS), this industry operated by renting rooms in various parts of Asan for two months during the winter to produce Chaku. For about 12 years, we earned our livelihood by making Chaku in Prajapati Tol, Thamel. Eventually, after staying in various places, we began producing Chaku in our own home around 2001–2002 (2058–059 BS).

Around 2003 (2060 BS), the first article about Tokha and Chaku by Gokarna Aryal was published in the *Gorkhapatra*. Since then, national newspapers and various media outlets have focused on Tokha's Chaku, publishing and broadcasting numerous articles and news reports.

Shree Krishna Chaku Production Pvt. Ltd. is associated with 5–10 organizations through various awards, letters of appreciation, and certificates. The first significant cash prize I received was in 2012 (2069 BS) at the National Industrial Exhibition organized by the Cottage and Small Industries Development Committee, where we won the "Best Award" in the Food and Beverage category. After receiving this award, the winning entrepreneurs were given the opportunity to visit and observe industrial corridors in various parts of India. These visits have encouraged entrepreneurs to move toward a more industrial lifestyle and have boosted our morale significantly.

Around 2018 (2075 BS), with the thought of gradually increasing production, I began manufacturing domestic machinery. Along with my childhood friend Gyan Kaji Prajapati, a resident of Prajapati Tol in Thamel, we utilized our collective wisdom to build a domestic machine at my home. My goal is to use this machine to produce Chaku at a time when laborers are becoming scarce in Tokha. Following the demand from members of the Tokha Traditional Chaku Preservation Society, we have manufactured and provided these machines. I am committed to gradually producing Chaku machinery for other companies as well.

Although I wished for all my colleagues to work under a single umbrella called the "Tokha Chaku Traders Association" since 2014 (2071 BS), it was only in 2016 (2073 BS) that all Tokha Chaku entrepreneurs gathered to register and operate the "Tokha Traditional Chaku Preservation Society." During the society's first anniversary in 2016, we honored our elders. In that ceremony, our guardians Bhakta Shrestha, Kashilal Shrestha, Krishnalal Shrestha, Nhuchhenarayan Shrestha, and Bhailal Shrestha were felicitated. Similarly, on October 31, 2020 (Kartik 15, 2077 BS), during the society's second anniversary, we honored the 106-year-old *Dey Thakali* (city elder) of historical Tokha, Tulsi Narayan Shrestha.

I am satisfied with the Chaku profession. Regardless of the highs and lows, I will continue this work. If we do not persevere, the historical markers of our culture and tradition will be erased. There is a saying that if one becomes even a small-scale entrepreneur, they will never have to face hunger.

On December 20, 2013 (Poush 5, 2070 BS), I gave my first interview on FM radio during the "Entrepreneur" program. Since 2017 (2074 BS), I have been continuously giving interviews on Chaku in the *Lahana* Nepal Bhasa program on Ujyaalo FM. In 2019 (2076 BS), I provided special interviews on Chaku for Nepal Television’s agricultural program and the BBC Nepali Service. Similarly, on January 11, 2021 (Poush 28, 2077 BS), Manju Karki conducted a Chaku-focused interview for over 45 minutes on the *Dekhapadhni* online special program. Various outlets including Power Media Network, Lokpath, Setopati, Sisan Baniya’s VLOG channel, Kathaharu Afno (Kantipur), Soltee Media, Nepal Tourism, Niratara, Shivapuri Media, Annapurna, Purano Khona TV, Gorkhabhumi, Nepal Live, Avenue TV, Nepal News, Kandhara News, Mankakura, Mountain TV, Kantipur TV, Image Channel, Yummy Food World, Aankhijhyal, Samachar Desk, Swasthya Khabar, Him Shikhar, and Nepalmandal TV have also featured segments on Tokha Chaku.

On January 1, 2021 (Poush 18, 2077 BS), Kantipur Television broadcasted a live segment on Chaku production at 8:00 AM. Around 2020, during Triyog School's 25th anniversary, we conducted a live demonstration of Tokha Chaku and traditional *Dhiki Chiura* (beaten rice) making. There is also a history of teachers and students from various schools in Tokha Municipality visiting our production site for direct observation.

I would especially like to thank the media outlets of Tokha—Tokha Darpan, Uttari Darpan, Tokha Times Monthly, NewsofTokha.com, TokhaTimes.com, and TokhaLive.com. My special thanks go to my unforgettable friends Sanukaji Thapa (Bal Kumari Movies House) from Sangla Tarakeshwor and Kumar Ranjit from Maru, Kathmandu, for prioritizing Tokha’s original traditional festivals, culture, and tangible/intangible heritage, making Tokha a focal point of promotion.
