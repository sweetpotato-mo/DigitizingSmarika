# The Necessity of Unity for Tokha Chaku

An organization is born out of necessity. It was with the goal of unifying the scattered **Chaku** (molasses taffy) entrepreneurs of Tokha that the **Tokha Chaku Preservation Society** was established. Founded on the advice and wisdom of local intellectuals, this society aims to unify producers to streamline production and sales. We are pleased to announce that this organization was formed with the unanimous support of all local Chaku entrepreneurs.

The Society is actively working to identify entrepreneurs within the Tokha settlement, analyze their challenges, manage market distribution, and bridge the gap between local producers and those outside the region. Our primary objective is to safeguard the authentic, original taste of Chaku in this historic city—a place flourishing with historical, cultural, and indigenous philosophy.

The road ahead presents significant questions. To find the answers, we must sharpen our long-term vision. We need to find a path that balances the hard work and legacy of our ancestors with our current needs. If we stand united, the future of this industry is exceptionally bright. By introducing modern machinery to produce items like lollipops and chocolate-style bars, our artisans would gain the capability to operate with energy throughout the entire year.

A majority of Nepal’s population relies on agriculture. Wherever Newari traditions, arts, and culture exist, they are accompanied by music and festivals (*Jatras*). This cultural richness strengthens the unity of all ethnicities across Nepal. Similarly, the flavor of Tokha Chaku acts as a catalyst in unifying people’s sentiments. Our cuisine and culture attract people from across the country. In this spirit, we have sought to organize our traditional industry under the "Tokha Chaku" brand. We cordially invite all entrepreneurs to join our Society.



However, the challenges are multifaceted. Small-scale investors struggle with market access, while large-scale investors face shortages of raw materials and liquid capital. Furthermore, financial institutions are often hesitant to trust Chaku businesses, or they offer loans at high-interest rates. We also face the arbitrary pricing of jaggery (*Sakhar*) syndicates and the issue of non-local traders selling unlabelled, inferior products under the "Tokha Chaku" name.

It is clear that our morale would be bolstered if the Tokha Municipality provided subsidized raw materials, low-interest loans, and better market management. There is also an urgent need for skilled labor training and the construction of cold storage facilities to preserve our products. Moving forward, it is essential for the government and the Ministry of Industry to engage meaningfully with entrepreneurs to ensure this heritage thrives.
