# The Glory of Chaku in Our Culture

**May we revitalize the tradition of "Pipikhuna" through Chaku: Best Wishes!**

I have been eating Chaku since my childhood. There has long been a tradition of singing, *"Yomari chwamu, uki dune hamu, nayebale chaku..."* (The Yomari is pointed, inside is sesame, and when eaten, it’s Chaku...) during the Yomari Punhi festival. This has become a delightful game for children. Who doesn’t love Chaku? After all, as the saying goes, "Red is beautiful, and sweet is delicious."

Tokha is a model of Newar civilization that developed as early as the Lichhavi period. Even then, it had become the central hub for supplying Chaku to the people of the entire Kathmandu Valley. To this day, regardless of where you are in the Valley, if people from Tokha arrive, it is naturally assumed that they have brought Chaku with them.

Chaku is a powerful tonic. Consuming it immediately generates heat within the body. Therefore, it is a staple food during the cold winter months. In our tradition, a specific day during winter has been dedicated as "Ghyo-Chaku Sankranti" (Maghe Sankranti) to celebrate this warming food.

Whenever we speak of Chaku, jaggery (*Sakhar*) inevitably comes to mind, as Chaku evolved directly from it. In our culture, Chaku is not just for festivals and fairs; there is a tradition of serving ghee, Chaku, sesame, honey, and ginger across all life-cycle rituals, from birth to death. Such is the glory of Chaku that it holds a position of immense importance in our culinary heritage.

In Patan, at the Mahapal Nhyaykan Bahil (monastery), a medicinal confection called "**Pipikhuna**" used to be prepared. Made with a base of Chaku and carrying a slightly spicy flavor, it was a traditional medicine crafted by the *Gubhajus* (priests). Because it effectively cured coughs in children, people from various villages used to travel there specifically to buy it. I know well that people even built houses in Patan solely from the income of selling that medicine.

For those suffering from a cough, "Pipikhuna" is a true panacea. It is a tradition that can still be developed today. Chaku entrepreneurs should make an effort in this direction, and it would be beneficial if the government provided subsidies to encourage its production.

In conclusion, I offer my best wishes that Chaku entrepreneurs may protect our original heritage while protecting traditional methods, and that they may continue to move forward in a way that suits the modern era.
