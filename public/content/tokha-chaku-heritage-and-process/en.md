# Tokha Chaku

**Madan Shrestha** | Author, Litterateur, and Advocate

### Introduction
The geographical structure of Tokha is an elevated terrain, with fertile agricultural lands surrounding it in all directions. It is a scenic location for farmers. Historical texts clarify that Tokha was built during or even before the Lichhavi period. Tokha can be considered a primary location for the indigenous Newar people during the era of human settlement in the Kathmandu Valley.

Tokha is abundant in agricultural land nestled between beautiful waterfalls and lush forests. By constructing artistic shrines, pilgrimage sites, temples, monasteries, wells, stone spouts, and rest houses, and by developing related Guthis, rituals, music, dances, festivals, and celebrations, the heritage of Tokha flourished. Since the time of Jung Bahadur Rana, it has been confirmed that Tokha Chaku industries were established for cultural and economic development, exporting products both domestically and abroad. In this context, the indigenous Newars and their descendants have proven capable of harmonizing their cultural lifestyle with religious philosophy.

### Significance
In birth rituals, a pregnant woman is fed *Dhau Baji* (yogurt and beaten rice) by her family. Sweets and fruits are offered, and on the fourth day after the child is born, the household is purified with a feast of meat dishes, beaten rice, legumes, and Chaku. Specifically, *Ghyo-Chaku* (ghee and molasses) is fed to the mother, and pure mustard oil is rubbed on the body. During the marriage process, Chaku is mandatory when sending the initial *Lakha* (wedding gifts), followed by other auspicious offerings like clothes, jewelry, fruits, yogurt, and betel nuts. Even today, the use of sesame, *gundpak*, barfi, and Chaku is mandatory in the *Lakha* process.

On the day of *Yomari Punhi* (Post-harvest Full Moon) in the month of Mangsir, our community kneads rice flour into a shape that is pointed at one end and flattened at the other, filling it with ghee, Chaku, and sesame before steaming. These are placed in granaries and worshipped in the name of deities like Lakshmi and Kubera. Similar to playing *Deusi*, there is a tradition in the Newar community of going from house to house. During this time, there is a custom of singing traditional songs like "Tyachhi tya bakachhi tya..." while requesting *Yomari*. Therefore, the use of Chaku is mandatory during this festival as well.

*Maghe Sankranti* is celebrated by the Newar community as *Ghyo-Chaku Sallhu*. After ritual bathing and worship at holy sites, feasts are enjoyed featuring Ghyo-Chaku dishes along with yams, black sesame balls, meat, and other varieties. Chaku is given great importance during this *Sankranti* as well.

### Historical Chaku Locations
Sugarcane is crushed in large quantities, and the resulting juice is boiled into a thick paste. The place where the juice was extracted and the sugarcane pulp was discarded was named **Tu:khya**. This word later evolved into the name **Tokha**. Discussions with elders reveal that sugarcane was cultivated in the following locations:
(a) Taikhel (b) Sapra (Deu Dyah-khya) (c) Tarcha (d) Phansital (e) Imdol (f) Galindol (Tukhya Hill)
Sugarcane was planted in these areas, buried in pits according to the season, retrieved, cleaned, crushed to extract juice, and cooked into a thick paste to prepare Chaku.

### Activities
(1) First, the land was plowed and leveled. Then, furrows (2–4 feet wide) were made according to the required length, filled with compost, and covered with soil. Sugarcane was then planted on both sides of the furrow.
(2) After a month, the sugarcane was weeded. If grass grew back, it was removed, and compost was again added to the furrows and covered with soil. This work continued from Mangsir to Chaitra. Subsequently, the sugarcane would grow. When the following month of Mangsir arrived, the harvesting work would begin.
(3) Throughout the month of Poush, the sugarcane was cleaned. In Magh, it was cut into pieces. In Falgun, pits 5 feet deep and 6–8 feet wide/long were dug, and the sugarcane was buried. The cane remained underground through Falgun and Chaitra. It was retrieved from the pits between Baisakh and Jestha.
(4) The sugarcane was cleaned thoroughly. Once ready, it was taken to the crushing site, known as the **Bhugay**. These sites were located wherever there was an abundance of sugarcane.
(5) At the *Bhugay*, large quantities of sugarcane juice, also referred to as "sugarcane oil," were extracted. Chaku was made from this juice.
(6) To extract the juice, an 8-foot-wide and 8-foot-long wooden device called a **Yansi** was used, with leather straps acting as a screw mechanism. When extracting juice, one strong person would sit on top (*Chwoyamha*) and another directly below (*Kwoyamha*). When needed, the *Chwoyamha* and *Kwoyamha* would alternate positions. Specifically, when the *Chwoyamha* jumped, the *Kwoyamha* provided a brace, and the *Chwoyamha* adjusted the base of the *Yansi*. As this work continued, the juice was extracted. This juice was kept in a clay vessel called an *Atha* and stirred slowly with a wooden ladle. Then, the liquid was cooked in a clay pot (*Kasi*) for about half an hour with constant stirring. The cooked juice was kept in an *Atha*, and once cooled, the Chaku-making process began.

At one time, the individuals directing the Tokha Chaku production included:
(1) Chandrabir Dangol (2) Harancha Dangol (3) Sahalubi Bhaicha Dangol (4) The Chief Leader of Tokha.
These accounts are provided by Tikanarayan Shrestha of Tokha Chandeshwor, Ward No. 3. Currently, in the evolution of Chaku, production is limited to using jaggery instead of raw sugarcane, and residents earn income by working on jaggery-based Chaku specifically in Mangsir, Poush, and Magh.

Tokha Chaku products found recognition both at home and abroad. Historical records mention that during the Rana regime, Prime Minister Jung Bahadur Rana, who reached Britain four months and eleven days after departing Kathmandu via the Chisapani Fort route, presented Chaku as a gift to Queen Victoria. Expensive gifts like ivory and rhino horns were certainly not new to Queen Victoria, but the authentic Nepali creation, Chaku, was undoubtedly a novel and unique gift for her.
